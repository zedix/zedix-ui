# Dialog

`zx-dialog` is based on the [native HTML dialog element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog), that has  has reached the tipping point of generally being the [better option](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2023/01/26/use-the-dialog-element.html) for web developers who need to implement dialogs.

It provides native support for:
- **Modal/inert functionality**. Opening the dialog as _modal_ will make the rest of the document [inert](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#modal-dialogs-and-inert-subtrees).
- **Promotion to the top layer**. Dialog will appear in the [top layer](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-4/#document-top-layer) of the page, so you don't have to play around with z-index.
- **Light-dismiss functionality**. Clicking outside of the dialog area will close the dialog and return focus.
- **Default focus management**. Opening the dialog will natively handle the [focusing steps](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interactive-elements.html#dialog-focusing-steps).
- **Accessible keyboard bindings**. Hitting the `esc` key or double toggling will close the dialog and return focus.
- **CSS ::backdrop**. Native dialog comes with a [::backdrop pseudo-element](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-backdrop-inheritance), rendered immediately beneath the dialog.
